# 503nhw
This is a sentiment analysis API built using FastAPI and a pre-trained Hugging Face model. It was built as part of an assignment involving deploying AI models as API services and gaining experience with collaborative version control using GitHub.

The API accepts a string of text and returns a sentiment classification result (positive, negative, or neutral) and a confidence score. The service is exposed via RESTful endpoints and includes additional features such as input validation,language detection, and a health check endpoint.


(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux
```


### `POST /language-detect`
Detects the language of the provided text.  
**Request:**
```json
{ "text": "Bonjour tout le monde" }
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "input": "Bonjour tout le monde",
  "language": "fr"
}
```

---

### `GET /health`
Simple health check to verify the API is live.  
**Response:**
```json
{ "status": "ok", "message": "API is running smoothly." }
```

## üìÅ Project Files

| File             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `main.py`        | Main FastAPI app with all route definitions |
| `requirements.txt` | Lists all dependencies |
| `README.md`      | Documentation (this file) |
| `test_data.py`   | Sample input cases for testing |
| `app.log`        | Logs of predictions and system status |

How to Run:

Install dependencies by running: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the API server with: uvicorn main:app --reload

Open a browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
This will open the interactive Swagger UI where you can experiment with the endpoints.

Available Endpoints:

POST /analyze
Accepts a JSON body with text. Example request:
{ "text": "I love this project!" }
Returns the sentiment classification and confidence score.

GET /health
Returns a plain status message to verify the API is running. Example response:
{ "status": "ok" }

POST /language-detect
Detects the language of the provided text.  
{ "text": "Bonjour tout le monde" }
Returns the language of the input.
